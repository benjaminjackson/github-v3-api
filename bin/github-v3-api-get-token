This script will start a sinatra web app on your machine that can log you in to
GitHub and show you your access token. This access token can then be used with
the GitHubV3API.

Once the server has started, just browse to http://localhost:4567. You may be
prompted to log in to GitHub and/or authorize the app.  After that, your access
token will be displayed to you.

You will need to create a GitHub Application in order to use this. Just go to
https://github.com/account/applications/new and fill out the form. Pick any name
you want, and use http://localhost:4567 and
http://localhost:4567/auth/github/callback for the Main and Callback URLs,
respectively. After creating the application, use the generated client id and
client secret by running this script with the OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and
OATH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET environment variables set.
